**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Versions (please complete the following information):**

 - Checkbox Type: [Debian, Snap]
 - Checkbox Version: [e.g. 2.0.0]

**Additional context**
- Hardware being tested (CPU, GPU, ...):
- Relevant logs:
  - Checkbox session(s) (located in `/var/tmp/checkbox-ng/sessions/`, you usually want to select the most recent one)
  - logs from the impacted components (e.g. `lsblk` if this is related to an issue when testing a disk...); a safe option is to install and run `sosreport` to gather as much log as possible.
